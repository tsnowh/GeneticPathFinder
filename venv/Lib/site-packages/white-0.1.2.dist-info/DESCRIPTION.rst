White: Black, but brighter (PEP8‚Äìinspired)
==========================================

`Black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ is an amazing tool for auto‚Äìformatting
Python code in a style that I prefer. I use it in all my projects.

It has **one** configuration option ‚Äî to change its default line‚Äìlength of ``88``
chars to, say, ``79``, like `PEP8 <http://pep8.org>`_ recommends.

That is exactly what this tool does. It invokes ``$ black --line-length 79`` on your behalf.


Usage
=====

::

    $ white myapp.py
    reformatted myapp.py
